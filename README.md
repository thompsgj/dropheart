A web application that combines the fun and interactive elements of Geocaching with the functionality of a CRUD app for donations.

where people can pick up approved items like socks, masks, period products, etc.
, anonymously. The app will feature a map interface for users to locate and donate items. 
Additionally, it will include data visualization to show the demand and supply of donated items in different areas, 
helping identify where needs are greatest.
